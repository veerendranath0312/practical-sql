# Practical SQL, 2nd Edition
### A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data

[Practical SQL, 2nd Edition](https://nostarch.com/practical-sql-2nd-edition/) is a beginner-friendly guide to the database programming language SQL. Author [Anthony DeBarros](https://www.anthonydebarros.com) starts with beginner SQL concepts such as queries, data types, and basic math and aggregation, and then works through intermediate and advanced topics including statistics, cleaning data, GIS, and automating tasks. Along the way, you'll use real-world data from the U.S. Census and other government agencies and learn the fundamentals of good database design. This is a book not only about SQL but about best practices for using it for thorough, accurate data analysis.


## Which Database Does The Book Use?

The book uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), which is free and open source. PostgreSQL is used by some of the world's largest companies. **Its SQL syntax adheres closely to the ANSI SQL standard**, and the concepts you learn will apply to most database management systems, including MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, and others. Note that Microsoft SQL Server employs a variant of SQL called T-SQL, which is not covered by Practical SQL.

**Warning about CSV files!**: Opening CSV files with Excel could lead to data loss. Excel will remove leading zeros from numbers that are intended to be stored as text, such as ZIP codes. To view the contents of a CSV file, only do so with a plain-text editor and be careful not to save the file in an encoding other than UTF-8.
